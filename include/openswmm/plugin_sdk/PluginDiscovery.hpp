/**
 * @file PluginDiscovery.hpp
 * @brief Public, framework-free facade for enumerating plugin file filters.
 *
 * @details Hosts (Qt GUIs, CLI tools, Python bindings) typically only need to
 *          know what file formats the engine and its plugins handle, not the
 *          full lifecycle. This header exposes a one-shot discovery facade
 *          that walks every built-in default plugin plus every on-disk
 *          plugin shared library, and returns the flat list of FileFilter
 *          entries each plugin advertises.
 *
 *          Internally this constructs a transient `PluginFactory`, so calling
 *          `discover_all_filters()` triggers a directory scan. Callers should
 *          cache the result.
