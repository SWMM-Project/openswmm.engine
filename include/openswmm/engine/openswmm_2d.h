 * @brief Optional 2D surface routing module — C API.
 *
 * @details Provides query and control of the optional 2D surface routing
 *          module coupled to the 1D SWMM pipe network. The 2D module is
 *          active when [2D_VERTICES] and [2D_TRIANGLES] sections are present
 *          in the input file and the engine was compiled with OPENSWMM_BUILD_2D.
 *
 *          All functions require the engine to be in SWMM_STATE_RUNNING
 *          unless otherwise noted. Functions return SWMM_ERR_BADPARAM if
 *          the 2D module is not active.
