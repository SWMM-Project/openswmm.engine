/**
 * @file openswmm_engine.h
 * @brief OpenSWMM Engine — primary transparent C API (master header).
 *
 * @details This is the main public header for the openswmm.engine library
 *          (version 6.0.0-alpha.1). It defines:
 *            - Error / warning / state enums
 *            - Engine lifecycle functions (create, open, init, start, step, end, close, destroy)
 *            - Callback registration
 *            - Simulation timing
 *            - Error reporting
 *            - The SWMM_ENGINE_API export macro
 *
 *          Domain-specific APIs are in separate headers:
 *            - openswmm_datetime.h      — SWMM DateTime encode/decode utilities
 *            - openswmm_model.h         — model building, validation, serialisation, options, user flags
 *            - openswmm_nodes.h         — node creation, properties, state, forcing, bulk
 *            - openswmm_links.h         — link creation, properties, cross-sections, state, bulk
 *            - openswmm_subcatchments.h — subcatchment creation, properties, state, bulk
 *            - openswmm_gages.h         — rain gage creation, properties, rainfall
 *            - openswmm_massbalance.h   — continuity errors and flux totals
 *            - openswmm_hotstart.h      — hot start file management
 *            - openswmm_callbacks.h     — callback typedefs
 *
 *          Including this header pulls in ALL of the above (master include).
 *          To use a single domain, include just that domain header.

 * Typical usage:

 * swmm_engine_initialize(e);
 * swmm_engine_start(e, 1);
 *
 * double elapsed = 0.0;
 * while (swmm_engine_step(e, &elapsed) == SWMM_OK && elapsed > 0.0) {
 *     // read/write node depths, link flows, etc.
 * }
 *
 * swmm_engine_end(e);
 * swmm_engine_report(e);
 * swmm_engine_close(e);
 * swmm_engine_destroy(e);
