/**
 * @file openswmm_callbacks.h
 * @brief Callback function typedefs for the OpenSWMM Engine C API.
 *
 * @details Callbacks allow host applications to receive runtime notifications
 *          from the simulation engine without polling. Register callbacks via
 *          the corresponding swmm_set_*_callback() functions.
 *
 *          All callbacks are invoked on the **main simulation thread** unless
 *          otherwise noted. Callbacks must be thread-safe with respect to the
 *          IO thread (i.e., do not modify simulation state from within a
 *          callback unless the engine is in a safe state).
 *
 * @note All callback function pointers accept a `void* user_data` parameter
 *       that is passed through unmodified from registration. Use this to
 *       carry context (e.g., a Python capsule, a C++ object pointer, etc.).
 *
 * @ingroup engine_api
 *
 * @see openswmm_engine.h for registration functions.

 * @brief Called after each simulation timestep to report progress.
 *
 * @details Invoked from inside swmm_engine_step() after advancing the
 *          simulation by one timestep. The callback receives the current
 *          elapsed fraction (0.0 to 1.0) and absolute simulation time.
 *
 * @param engine        The engine handle that fired the callback.
 * @param elapsed_frac  Fraction of simulation complete [0.0, 1.0].
 * @param sim_time      Current simulation time as a SWMM DateTime double
 *                      (decimal days since 1899-12-30; see `openswmm_datetime.h`).
 * @param user_data     User-supplied context pointer from registration.
 *
 * @note This callback is called on every physical timestep, which may be
 *       very frequent. Keep the callback implementation lightweight.
 *
 * Example (C):
 * @code{.c}
 * void my_progress(SWMM_Engine e, double frac, double t, void* ud) {
 *     printf("Progress: %.1f%%  t=%.4f days\n", frac * 100.0, t);
 * }
