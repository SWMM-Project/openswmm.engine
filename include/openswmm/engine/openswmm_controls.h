/**
 * @brief Validate a control-rule text block without storing it.
 *
 * @details Runs the engine's control-rule parser against the engine's live
 *          @ref SimulationContext for name resolution (NODE / LINK / CURVE /
 *          TIMESERIES references), but **does not** mutate the engine's rule
 *          list or PID state. Designed for GUI-side live validation where
 *          the editor needs the production parser's accept/reject verdict
 *          on each keystroke without side effects.
 *
 *          The validation contract matches @ref swmm_control_add_rule
 *          followed by a simulation-initialisation parse: identical input
 *          text yields identical accept/reject. Engine state across the
 *          call is invariant — `swmm_control_count`, `swmm_control_get_rule`,
 *          and the engine's internal `ControlEngine::rules()` vector are
 *          unchanged.
 *
 *          On reject the function returns @ref SWMM_ERR_BADPARAM and writes
 *          a short human-readable message to @p errbuf (truncated to fit).
 *          Line-precise error reporting is not yet wired through the parser;
 *          @p line_out is set to `-1` on reject. Future work may carry a
 *          1-based line index through the parser.
 *
 * @param engine     Engine handle.
 * @param rule_text  Null-terminated rule text. Same grammar as the
 *                   `[CONTROLS]` section.
 * @param errbuf     [out, optional] Buffer for the rejection message. May
 *                   be NULL or zero-length to suppress message capture.
 * @param buflen     Size of @p errbuf in bytes.
 * @param line_out   [out, optional] 1-based line number of the rejection,
 *                   or `-1` if not available. May be NULL.
 * @returns SWMM_OK if the parser accepts the text, SWMM_ERR_BADPARAM if it
 *          rejects, or another error code on infrastructure failure.
