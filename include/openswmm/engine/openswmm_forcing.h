 * @file openswmm_forcing.h
 * @brief Runtime forcing API — inject fluxes with mass-balance tracking.
 *
 * @details Provides per-element runtime forcing of lateral inflows, head
 *          boundaries, rainfall, evaporation, link settings, and quality mass
 *          fluxes. Each forcing specifies:
 *
 *            - **mode**: NONE (disabled), OVERRIDE (replace computed value),
 *                        ADD (add to computed value)
 *            - **persistence**: RESET (auto-clear after each timestep),
 *                               PERSIST (keep until explicitly cleared)
 *
 *          Forced volumes are tracked in the mass balance and reported
 *          separately via SWMM_ROUTING_FORCING.
 *
 *          All forcing functions require SWMM_STATE_RUNNING.
 *
 * @section forcing_lifecycle Lifecycle
 *
 * @code
 * swmm_engine_start(e, 1);
 * while (swmm_engine_step(e, &elapsed) == SWMM_OK && elapsed > 0) {
 *     // Set forcings for this step (or let PERSIST carry forward)
 *     swmm_forcing_node_lat_inflow(e, j1, 10.0,
 *         SWMM_FORCING_ADD, SWMM_FORCING_PERSIST);
 *
 *     // ... step runs, forcing is applied, mass balance tracks it ...
 *     // RESET forcings auto-clear; PERSIST forcings remain
 * }
 * swmm_engine_end(e);
 * @endcode
 *
 * @note All value parameters are in the simulation's internal units (ft, sec,
 *       CFS) unless otherwise noted. Rainfall values are in user display units
 *       (in/hr for US, mm/hr for SI) — the engine converts internally.
