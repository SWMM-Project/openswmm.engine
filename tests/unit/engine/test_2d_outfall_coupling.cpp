/**
 * @file test_2d_outfall_coupling.cpp
 * @brief End-to-end regression for two-way 1D↔2D OUTFALL coupling.
 *
 * @details A terminal outfall's pipe discharge accumulates into the node's
 *          `inflow` accumulator (water arriving from the connecting conduit),
 *          NOT its `outflow` accumulator (which stays ~0 except on backflow).
 *          The pre-fix `transferOutfallDischarges` read `nodes.outflow`, so the
 *          normal discharge was silently dropped — it never reached the 2D mesh
 *          and the coupled 1D+2D mass balance leaked it every step.
 *
 *          This test builds a 1D junction fed by a steady inflow, draining
 *          through a conduit to a FREE outfall that is coupled to a small 2D
 *          mesh. With the fix the outfall discharge is injected as a source into
 *          the coupled cell(s): the mesh wets, the 2D mass balance records the
 *          discharge under `outfall_in`, and BOTH the 2D surface continuity and
 *          the 1D routing continuity close. On the pre-fix code the mesh stays
 *          dry (peak depth ~0) and `outfall_in` ~0, so the assertions below fail.
 *
 *          Tailwater feedback (updateOutfallBoundaries → setAllOutfallDepths)
 *          throttles the discharge as the 2D cell fills, so the depth
 *          equilibrates rather than growing unbounded — the two-way coupling.
 *
 *          Needs the full 2D module (OPENSWMM_BUILD_2D); runs the real coupled
 *          engine through the public C API. Inputs and a mass-balance summary
 *          are written to ./outfall_coupling_out/ (the test's working dir is the
 *          repo's tests/unit/engine/data), so a reviewer can inspect them — no
 *          temp files (project convention).

// ============================================================================
// Buried-outfall drain-recovery regression (the dry-threshold deadlock).
// ============================================================================
//
// The model above sits on a FLAT mesh at Z=0 matching the outfall invert, so
// bed_z == z_inv and the wet/dry-gate bug never fires. The real failure needs a
// BURIED outfall: the 2D cell bed (ground surface) is ABOVE the outfall invert
// because the pipe daylights at the surface (the common physical case). Here the
// patch sits at Z=3.0 m while O1's invert is 0.0 m.
//
// Pre-fix, updateOutfallBoundaries gated the 2D tailwater override on a private
// 0.1 mm threshold — smaller than the 2D solver's own dry_depth. After the storm
// the patch drains to a residual film at/just below dry_depth that the surface
// solver treats as immovable (dry), yet the coupling still read it as wet and
// cached h_2d = bed_z + film ≈ 3 m as the outfall tailwater. That phantom 3 m
// stage pinned the downstream BC, so the upstream junction J1 could not drain
// below ~2 m (head 3 m − invert 1 m) — a deadlock, even though the surface is
// effectively dry.
//
// The fix shares the solver's dry_depth and ramps the override to zero at/below
// it (free discharge when dry), so once the patch drains the outfall frees and
// J1 empties. A two-phase inflow wets the patch, then stops so it drains; the
// NORMAL_FLOW outflow edges let the ponded water leave the domain.
