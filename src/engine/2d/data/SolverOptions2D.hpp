 * NONE (no preconditioning) and JACOBI (per-cell diagonal approximation
 * rebuilt each Jacobian refresh) are always available. AMG (hypre BoomerAMG)
 * is wired only when the engine is built with OPENSWMM_WITH_HYPRE; selecting
 * it otherwise triggers a clear runtime error in the solver's initialize().
 * ILU remains a reserved-but-rejected slot.
 *
 * Tier rationale (see also the Phase 1/2 discussion in
 * docs/2D_KNOWN_STIFFNESS_ISSUE.md):
 *
 *   - NONE   : baseline; useful for measuring how much the Jacobi heuristic
 *              actually buys at a given mesh size.
 *   - JACOBI : O(n) setup, O(n) apply, embarrassingly parallel. Effective
 *              while the Newton matrix M = I − γJ is diagonally dominant;
 *              expected to scale acceptably to ~10k–50k cells.
 *   - ILU    : O(nnz) setup + apply via KLU. Better convergence per
 *              Krylov iteration than JACOBI but still asymptotically
 *              non-scalable on this elliptic operator. *Not implemented*.
 *   - AMG    : O(n) setup amortised, near-constant Krylov iterations
 *              regardless of mesh size. The only scalable option past
 *              ~100k cells. Requires hypre/BoomerAMG. *Not yet wired.*
