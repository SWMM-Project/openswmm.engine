 * @brief Backend-neutral interface for the 2D surface-routing time integrator.
 *
 * @details Phase 0 of the portable GPU CVODE strategy
 *          (docs/2D_GPU_PORTABLE_CVODE_STRATEGY.md §6). Extracts the solver
 *          contract that SurfaceRouter2D depends on so the concrete solver
 *          can be chosen at runtime:
 *
 *            ISurfaceSolver
 *             ├── CvodeSurfaceSolver        (serial CPU; today's path, default)
 *             └── CvodeKokkosSurfaceSolver  (GPU plugin; lands Phase 2+)
 *
 *          This header is dependency-free (no SUNDIALS, no Kokkos): it only
 *          forward-declares the 2D data types it passes by reference, so it
 *          compiles regardless of which backend — if any — is available.

 * (hot start), and teardown. The two stat accessors expose the most recent
 * integrator step diagnostics for reporting.
 *
 * Implementations are non-copyable (they own backend resources) and owned
 * by SurfaceRouter2D through a unique_ptr<ISurfaceSolver>; the virtual
 * destructor makes that deletion correct.
