/**
 * @file GpuPluginAbi.h
 * @brief Stable C ABI between the core engine and an optional GPU solver plugin.
 *
 * @details Phase 0 scaffolding for the portable GPU CVODE strategy
 *          (docs/2D_GPU_PORTABLE_CVODE_STRATEGY.md §4.1). The GPU backend
 *          ships as a SEPARATE shared library that the core discovers and
 *          dlopen()s at runtime; it is never linked into openswmm_engine.
 *          Communication therefore crosses a plain C ABI so it is robust to
 *          compiler/toolchain differences between the core and the plugin
 *          (which may be built with nvcc/hipcc/icpx against Kokkos).
 *
 *          Two symbols form the contract:
 *            - openswmm_gpu_probe()              — cheap capability query
 *            - openswmm_make_gpu_surface_solver()— factory for the backend
 *
 *          The factory returns an ISurfaceSolver* as a void* (the core casts
 *          it back); ownership transfers to the core, which deletes through
 *          the ISurfaceSolver virtual destructor.

/*
 * Export/visibility marker for the two ABI entry points.
 *
 * The declaration here and the definition in each plugin .cpp must agree on
 * linkage or MSVC rejects the definition with C2375 ("redefinition; different
 * linkage") — a plain `extern "C"` declaration followed by an
 * `__declspec(dllexport)` definition is a mismatch. A plugin translation unit
 * defines OPENSWMM_GPU_PLUGIN_BUILD (see the gpu CMakeLists) so it both
 * declares and defines the symbols as dllexport. The core never link-imports
 * these (it resolves them via dlsym/GetProcAddress), so the non-plugin case is
 * a no-op marker.
