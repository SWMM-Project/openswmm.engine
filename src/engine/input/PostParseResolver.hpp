/**
 * @file PostParseResolver.hpp
 * @brief Post-parse cross-reference resolution for the input system.
 *
 * @details After all sections are parsed, some object references that
 *          appear forward (e.g., a subcatchment referencing a gage that
 *          appears later in the file) need to be resolved. This module
 *          performs a single sweep to fix up all -1 indices.
 *
 * Resolutions performed:
 * - `subcatch.gage[i]`     — re-look up by gage name
 * - `subcatch.outlet_node` — re-look up outlet by name
 * - `gages.ts_index`       — re-look up time series by name
 * - `nodes.outfall_param`  for TIDAL/TIMESERIES outfalls — resolve curve index
 * - `links.pump_curve`     — resolve pump curve by name
 *
 * @see InputReader.hpp — calls resolve() after all sections are dispatched
 * @ingroup engine_input

 *          @ref resolve_cross_references applies at parse time: it multiplies
 *          the same node/link/subcatchment length-, area-, flow-, and
 *          rainfall-dimensioned fields by the forward UCF instead of its
 *          reciprocal. The .inp writer needs display units, but the engine
 *          stores everything internally in feet/cfs, so a save must undo the
 *          parse-time conversion or each save→reopen cycle compounds the
 *          factor (the m→ft "exploding model" bug). US-unit models are a
 *          no-op (factor 1.0).
 *
 *          MUST stay field-for-field in sync with @c convert_inputs_to_internal
 *          in PostParseResolver.cpp — editing one without the other reintroduces
 *          the asymmetry.

 *          `ctx.gages.file_path[]`, `ctx.options.temp_file`, and every
 *          timeseries `Table::file_path`. For each non-empty slot,

 *                     lexically normalised against an empty base.
