OpenSWMM 6 User Guide  (refactored engine)
==========================================

.. note::

   These guides cover the **OpenSWMM 6 refactored engine** at
   :mod:`openswmm.engine`.  If you are looking for the original EPA SWMM
   5.x solver — preserved verbatim for backward compatibility — see
   :doc:`../legacy/index`.

The User Guide is the canonical "how do I do X?" reference for the
modern :mod:`openswmm.engine` API.  Every page follows the same layout:

* **Class signature** — the constructor and how the class fits in.
* **Key methods** — grouped by purpose (geometry, state, forcing, …).
* **End-to-end example** — a runnable snippet covering the typical
  workflow.
* **Common recipes** — short snippets for everyday tasks.
* **Bulk arrays** — the numpy-friendly accessors (``*_bulk``).
* **EngineState requirements & exceptions** — what's legal when, and
  what each method raises.

Newcomers, start with :doc:`../guide/install`,
:doc:`../guide/quickstart`, then :doc:`../guide/concepts`.
