"""Concurrent-simulation tests — verify the GIL is released during the C calls.

These tests exercise Phase 2a of the C-API/Bindings improvement plan
(`docs/C_API_BINDINGS_MCP_IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md`): the engine `step`/`stride`
calls and the `*_bulk` getters/setters on Nodes/Links/Subcatchments now wrap
their C call in `with nogil:` so that a second Python thread can advance an
independent engine handle in parallel.

The contract under test:

  1. Two independent ``Solver`` instances driven from two threads must
     complete in less wall-clock time than the sum of their single-threaded
     runtimes — proving the GIL is genuinely released during ``step``.
  2. Bulk getters called concurrently from many threads against the same
     solver must complete without deadlock, exception, or corruption (each
     call writes into its own caller-allocated NumPy array; the C engine's
     read of the state vectors is intrinsically thread-safe for reads).
  3. The wall-clock benefit of (1) is enough to be statistically detectable
     above noise. We require strictly *better* than serial, not a hard
     speedup ratio — busy CI machines and small fixtures suppress the
     theoretical 2× ceiling.

Notes on `pytest -k`:
  * Marked with ``@pytest.mark.slow`` because the parallelism check needs
    to do enough work to dominate startup overhead (~1 second per run on a
    laptop). Skip in fast smoke runs with ``-m "not slow"``.

    """Two engines stepped from two threads should finish faster than
    sequentially stepping the same two engines on one thread.

    This is the headline observable for Phase 2a — if the C engine
    held the GIL during ``step``, the two threads would serialise and
    the parallel wall time would equal the serial wall time (modulo
    noise). With the GIL released we expect a measurable speedup.

    Statistic — min of paired ratios:
      Each trial times a serial run and a parallel run BACK-TO-BACK on
      the same runner, so the two share whatever transient load is
      affecting the host (noisy neighbour, scheduler hiccup, kernel
      housekeeping). The per-trial ratio ``parallel / serial`` is then
      the cleanest possible single-observation speedup measurement,
      because the noise floor cancels out by construction.

      The test passes if ``min(ratios) < 0.95`` across ``N_TRIALS``
      paired trials — i.e. AT LEAST ONE clean trial shows ≥ 5 %
      speedup. This is what we actually want to assert: "there exists
      a runner condition under which two threads beat one by more
      than 5 %". The previous statistic (best-parallel / best-serial)
      could combine the parallel time from one trial with the serial
      time from another, contaminating the signal when runner load was
      uneven across trials — exactly what bit Intel mac CI on
      2026-05-26 (best parallel from trial 1, best serial from trial 2,
      apparent speedup 4.5 % when trial 1's true paired speedup was
      14 %).

      ``N_TRIALS = 5`` so we tolerate up to 4/5 trials being
      contaminated. With N_RUNS·2 = 8 simulations per parallel trial,
      a clean trial reliably shows ≥ 10 % paired speedup on every
      platform tested (macOS arm64, macOS x86_64, ubuntu x86_64,
      ubuntu aarch64, windows x86_64).
