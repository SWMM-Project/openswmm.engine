"""
P4 — Subcatchments collection + Subcatchment wrapper Pythonic tests.

Covers the container protocol, identity + geometry properties, gage
back-reference (returns Gage wrapper), runtime state, infiltration view
tagged-union, coverage MutableMapping, stats sub-view, and bulk numpy
properties. Staleness and equality are identical to nodes/links.
