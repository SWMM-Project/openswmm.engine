## Overview

OpenSWMM Engine is a community-driven, open-source continuation of the EPA Storm Water Management Model — a dynamic hydrology, hydraulic, and water-quality simulator for urban runoff. The project preserves the SWMM legacy under QA/QC and builds the community needed for long-term maintenance, working with ASCE/EWRI and the Water Environment Federation.

## What's New in v6.0.0

### Architecture & Performance

- **Data-Oriented Design** — Core state refactored to Structure-of-Arrays for cache efficiency and SIMD-friendly batches.
- **Reentrant Engine** — All simulation state lives behind an opaque `SWMM_Engine` handle; multiple independent simulations can run in the same process.
- **Plugin-Based I/O** — Output and report writing dispatch through plugin interfaces on a dedicated I/O thread.
- **C++20 Codebase** — Modern C++20 implementation; the legacy EPA SWMM 5.x solver is preserved unmodified in `src/legacy/`.

### Process Formulation Enhancements

#### Implemented

- **Semi-Implicit Node Continuity** — Single-equation free-surface/surcharge formulation that removes the legacy two-branch discontinuity. Enabled via `NODE_CONTINUITY SEMI_IMPLICIT` (default). [Reference »](https://hydrocouple.org/openswmm.engine)
- **Anderson Acceleration for Picard Iteration** — Depth-2 mixing of residual history cuts iteration counts 25–50% on stiff surcharge transitions with safe fall-back to standard Picard. Enabled via `ANDERSON_ACCEL YES`.
- **Spatially Explicit Overland Flow & Groundwater (2D)** — 2D overland-flow grid coupled to the 1D pipe network. Surcharge re-routes over terrain to downstream nodes, lateral groundwater exchanges are tracked explicitly, and green-infrastructure placement is spatially resolved.
- **Dynamic Preissmann Slot** — Geometry-dependent slot width replaces the fixed-width slot at the free-surface / pressurized transition, improving stability for rapidly filling or draining conduits.
- **Physics-Based Initial Abstraction Recovery** — RDII initial abstraction now evolves as an exponential depletion/recovery process with additive base + thermal recovery rates and frozen-ground suppression. Seasonal RDII variation emerges from temperature dynamics on a single RTK set per sewershed — no monthly parameter tables required. Configured via the new `[RDII_DECAY]` input section.

  $$IA_{avail}(t+\Delta t) = IA_{max} - \bigl(IA_{max} - IA_{avail}(t)\bigr) \cdot e^{-k_{rec}(T)\,\Delta t}, \quad k_{rec}(T) = k_0 + k_T \cdot e^{\,\theta(T - T_{ref})}$$

#### In Development

- **Spatially Explicit Inlets** — Promotes inlets to mode-switching junction nodes that capture street flow when gutter spread exceeds a threshold and revert to passive junctions otherwise.
- **LID as Storage Nodes** — Maps LID layers (surface, media, gravel) onto extended storage nodes using a reduced-physics kinematic Richards ODE for two-way hydraulic feedback.

### New C API

A domain-split C API replaces the monolithic legacy interface. Full reference at the [C engine documentation site](https://hydrocouple.org/openswmm.engine).

|---|---|
| `openswmm_engine.h` | Engine lifecycle, error codes, state machine |
| `openswmm_model.h` | Model building, validation, serialization, options |
| `openswmm_nodes.h` | Junctions, outfalls, storage, dividers |
| `openswmm_links.h` | Conduits, pumps, orifices, weirs, outlets |
| `openswmm_subcatchments.h` | Subcatchments, infiltration, coverage |
| `openswmm_gages.h` | Rain gages |
| `openswmm_pollutants.h` | Pollutant definitions and runtime injection |
| `openswmm_tables.h` | Time series, curves, patterns |
| `openswmm_inflows.h` | External inflows, DWF, RDII (incl. `[RDII_DECAY]`) |
| `openswmm_controls.h` | Control rules and direct link actions |
| `openswmm_infrastructure.h` | Transects, streets, inlets, LID controls |
| `openswmm_spatial.h` | CRS, coordinates, polylines, polygons |
| `openswmm_quality.h` | Landuse, buildup, washoff, treatment |
| `openswmm_massbalance.h` | Continuity errors and cumulative flux totals |
| `openswmm_callbacks.h` | Progress, warning, and step callbacks |
| `openswmm_hotstart.h` | Hot start file save / load / modify |
| `openswmm_statistics.h` | Node, link, and subcatchment statistics |

### Additional Features

- **Hot Start API** — Save, load, modify, and query hot-start files through a stable C ABI.
- **CRS Support** — Coordinate reference systems specified in `[OPTIONS]`.
- **User Flags** — Typed `[USER_FLAGS]` / `[USER_FLAG_VALUES]` sections attach custom metadata (boolean, integer, real, string) to nodes, links, subcatchments, or gages.
- **Extension Options** — Unrecognized `[OPTIONS]` keys are preserved and exposed to plugins at runtime.
- **Plugin SDK** — Header-only SDK in `include/openswmm/plugin_sdk/` for input, output, and report plugins; the `IPluginComponentInfo` entry point advertises capabilities and supports custom `.inp` section handlers via `SectionRegistry`.
- **GeoPackage I/O** — Optional SQLite + spatial backing store for inputs, results, observed series, and topology in a single `.gpkg` file (`-DOPENSWMM_WITH_GEOPACKAGE=ON`).
- **HEC-22 Inlet Analysis** — Street inlet capture with grate and curb inlets (SWMM 5.2).
- **Variable Speed Pumps** — Type 5 pump curves with speed scaling.
- **New Storage Shapes** — Conical and pyramidal shapes with elliptical and rectangular bases.

```

Presets: `Windows`, `Windows-debug`, `Linux`, `Linux-debug`, `Darwin`, `Darwin-debug`. Full build, test, and packaging instructions are in the [C engine docs](https://hydrocouple.org/openswmm.engine).

```python
from openswmm.engine import Solver, Nodes, Links

with Solver("model.inp", "model.rpt", "model.out") as s:
    nodes, links = Nodes(s), Links(s)
    while s.step():
        depth = nodes.get_depth("J1")
        flow  = links.get_flow("C1")
```

Forcing, model building, hot-start, bulk NumPy access, mass balance, and statistics are covered in the [Python docs](https://hydrocouple.org/openswmm.engine/python).

## Glossary

Brief definitions of the domain terms used throughout this README. Full treatment lives in the [reference manuals](https://hydrocouple.org/openswmm.engine).

- **RDII** — Rainfall-Dependent Inflow & Infiltration. Stormwater that enters sanitary or combined sewers through cracks, joints, defective laterals, and roof / foundation drains during and after rainfall.
- **RTK** — The triplet `(R, T, K)` that parameterises a SWMM synthetic unit hydrograph for RDII: `R` is the long-term fraction of rainfall that becomes RDII, `T` is the time to peak (hours), and `K` is the ratio of base time to peak time.
- **IA (Initial Abstraction)** — Rainfall depth absorbed by the catchment before any RDII response begins (interception, surface storage, soil wetting). Recovers between events.
- **DWF** — Dry-Weather Flow. Base sanitary flow plus infiltration unrelated to rainfall, typically specified as an average value with diurnal / day-of-week / monthly patterns.
- **LID** — Low-Impact Development. Distributed green-infrastructure controls (bio-retention cells, permeable pavement, green roofs, infiltration trenches, rain gardens) that intercept, store, and infiltrate runoff at the source.
- **CRS** — Coordinate Reference System. The geodetic / projected coordinate frame (e.g. `EPSG:4326`) the model's spatial data is expressed in.
- **CFS / CMS** — Cubic feet per second / cubic metres per second. The two flow-unit conventions exposed via `FLOW_UNITS`.
- **Dynamic Wave Routing** — Full Saint-Venant momentum solver for link flow, used for backwater, surcharge, and pressurized conditions.
- **Preissmann Slot** — A narrow virtual slot added to a closed conduit's cross-section so that pressurized flow can be solved with the same free-surface equations. The dynamic slot adjusts width with geometry to smooth the surface ↔ pressure transition.
- **Surcharge** — A pipe flowing full and under pressure (HGL above the crown), typically caused by downstream backwater or capacity exceedance.
- **Picard Iteration** — Fixed-point iteration used inside the dynamic-wave timestep to converge implicit node depths. Anderson Acceleration is a residual-history accelerator on top of Picard.
- **Hot Start** — A saved end-of-run state (depths, volumes, IA, snow, GW) that initialises a subsequent simulation, letting long runs be split into checkpoints or warm runs into operational forecasts.
- **HEC-22** — FHWA Hydraulic Engineering Circular No. 22, the design reference whose grate and curb-opening capture equations are used by the inlet-analysis module.
- **GeoPackage** — OGC standard for a SQLite-based, single-file container holding spatial features and tabular data with full CRS metadata.
